
**Que:-1 Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?**

**Ans:**
 
  <u>**HTML tag:**</u>
             
HTML Elements are components that are used in HTML Page. 
HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of a starting and an ending tag. 
some tags do not have a closing tag.
 
 <u>**Elements:**</u>
          
The content inside is typically displayed in italic. 
`<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another 
language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

**Que:-2 What are tags and attributes in HTML?**

**Ans:**

<u>**Tags:**</u>

The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it.
To get back to the point, `<html>` is the opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between that and the `</html>` closing tag is an HTML document. 
The stuff between `<body>` and `</body>` is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser window.
The `</body>` and `</html>` put a close to their respective elements.

 **For Example:üëç**

```html 
        <html>
        <head>
        <title> hii sir</title>
        </head>
        <body>
              GOOD MORNINIG SIRRR
              WELCOME TO MY COLLEGE
        </body>
        </HTML>
```

<u>**Attributes:**</u>

Tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks.
HTML  Attributes can be used to change the color,size OR Functionality of HTML elements.

          
  
**For Example:üëç**
```html
            <img src="/image/img2.jpg" alt=""/>

        City:
        <select name="" id="" required>
          <option value="">Baroda</option>
          <option value="">Rajkot</option>
          <option value="">Surat</option>
          <option value="">Junagadh</option>
          <option value="">jamnagae</option>
          <option value="">pune</option>
          <option value="">shikago</option>
          <option value=""> Kanpur</option>
        </select>
    
         <input type="email" name="" id="">

```
        
Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end of the element.

**Que:-3 What are void elements in HTML?** 

**Ans:**

<u>**Void Elements:**</u>

There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements.
Void elements doesn‚Äôt have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. 
These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. 

**For Exampleüëç** 

        <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, 
        <base>, <meta>, <param>, <area>, 
        <embed>,<col>, <track>, <source> etc.

---

**Que:-4  What are HTML Entities?** 

**Ans:**        

HTML Entity provides some methods to display reserved characters. 
Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those that are not present in the basic keyboard.
For instance, `‚Äò<‚Äò` is reserved in HTML language. if the less than `(<)` or greater than `(>)` signs are used in the code, it might be possible that the browser may think as a tag.
this character needs to be displayed on the web page which creates ambiguity in the code. 
Along with these are the characters that are normally not present in basic keyboards `( ¬£, ¬•, ‚Ç¨, ¬© )`, etc. 
HTML provides some Entity names and Entity numbers to use these symbols. Entity names are case-sensitive. 
Entity numbers are easy to learn. 

**For Examplae:üëç**    
 
 ```html  

<p>I will display &amp;	</p>
<p>I will display &copy;</p>
<p>I will display &nbsp; </p>

Output:

 I will display &	
 I will display ¬©
 I will display    

 ```

**Que:-9 How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?**

**Ans:** 
  
  Cell padding is used to create a border around the content area of a web page, whereas cell spacing is used for positioning elements (such as images or text) within that content area. Cell padding can be set through CSS, while cell spacing can only be controlled using HTML5.

  <u>**differences between Cell padding and cell spacing**</u>
 `Cellpadding` | `Cellspacing`
-----------|--------------
Cell padding is the term used to describe the area between a table cell‚Äôs border and its content. | The gap between each neighbouring cell is often called ‚Äúcellspacing.‚Äù|
It may be made using the HTML table> tag but changes the type property to cell padding.	|It may be produced using the HTML table> tag. However, that changes the type property to cell spacing.|
It concerns just one cell.|It is exposed to several cells (more than one) at once.
|The default value for cell padding is 1.|Cellspacing has a default value of 2.
|When compared to cell spacing, it is quite effective. It is, therefore, very commonly used.|Comparatively speaking, it is less efficient than cell padding.

**Que:-10 How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?**

**Ans:**

To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute. If you want to combine the first two cells in the first column, you can use the colspan="2" attribute in the first tag. The number represents how many cells to use (merge) for the tag.

**Que:-11 What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?**

**Ans:**

The inline and block elements of HTML are one of the important areas where web developers often get confused because they were unable to know which are inline and block elements which may cause clumsiness in a webpage in case he assumes some element to be a block but it is an inline element which causes next element comes next to it.

So let us see the differences between the inline and block elements in HTML and the different frequently used inline and block HTML elements. 

<u>**Block elements:**</u>

 They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.

**Examples of Block elements:üëç**
```html
<h1>-<h6> : This element is used for including headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6.
<div>: This is a container tag and is used to make separate divisions of content on the web page.
<hr>: This is an empty tag and is used for separating content by horizontal lines.
<li>: This tag is used for including list items of an ordered or unordered list.
<ul>: This tag is used to make an unordered list.
<ol>: This tag is used to make an ordered list.
<p>: This tag is used to include paragraphs of content in the webpage.
<table>: This tag is used for including the tables in the webpage when there is a need for tabular data. 
```
<u>**Inline elements:**</u>

 Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don‚Äôt start from a new line and don‚Äôt have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

**Examples of Inline elements:üëç**
```html
<a>: This tag is used for including hyperlinks in the webpage.
<br>: This tag is used for mentioning line breaks in the webpage wherever needed.
<input>: This tag is used for taking input from the users and is mainly used in forms.
<img>: This tag is used for including different images in the webpage to add beauty to the webpage.
<span>:  This is an inline container that takes necessary space only.
<b>:  This tag is used in places where bold text is needed.
<label>: The tag in HTML is used to provide a usability improvement for mouse users i.e, if a user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.
```

**Que:-12 How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?** 

 **Ans:**

To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the `<a>`and `</a>` tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The  `<a>` tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the `</a>` tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the `<a herf="">`.

**For Example:üëç**
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title> web page</title>
    </head>
<body>
<a href="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/900x510/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-20-small-dog-breeds.jpeg.jpg"> Dog</a>

**Que:-13What is the use of an iframe tag?**

**Ans:**

   An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.

**For Example:üëç**

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

**Que:-14What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?**

**Ans:**

 The `<span>` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
 The `<span>` tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
 The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.

**For Example:üëç**
```html
<html>
<body>

<h1>The span element</h1>

<p> My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> 
eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Que:-15How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?**

**Ans:**

 We can use the background attribute in the body tag to set an image as the background of the webpage. We will need to specify the URL or the location of the image which we want to set to the background attribute of the body tag.

**For Example:üëç**
```html
 <html>
<head>
<style>
body {  background-image:url(htitute-logo1651830982.png)

**Que:-16 How are active links different from normal links?**

**Ans:**

<u>**Active Link:**</u>


An Active link is a hyperlink that is currently being interacted with the user. Whenever the user holds the mouse button on the link and not released yet or if right clicked on it, it will change its color into red, this is when the link will be in active state.

The active state is temporary and ends once the user releases the mouse button. However, we can customize the style of the active links using the CSS properties

**For Example:üëç**
        
   ```html     
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            chinu malam
        </title>
    </head>
    <style>
        tr:hover{
            background-color: rgb(19, 7, 10);
            color: rgb(207, 207, 149);
        }
    </style>
    <caption>
        
        <td> <font color="black" align="center" hight="5" wight="5">
                 <h1> ENQUIRY FORM</h1>
        </td>

                        Fill The Form 
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
